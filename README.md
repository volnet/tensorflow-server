# tensorflow-server

## Why you need?

If you run docker from tensorflow/tensorflow, you can run `jupyter notebook` or `tensorboard`, but you can't run them at the same time.

You can run them by:

```
./tf_start_all.sh
```

and stop them by:

```
./tf_stop_all.sh
``` 

and open them in browser:

1. Jupyter Notebook: http://localhost:8888
2. TensorBoard: http://localhost:6006

## What's additional

You will find my notebooks in notebooks folder, my graphs in logs folder, you can delete them without any worry.
